# THIS IS THE README FILE FOR Server::FastPL 1.0 (I will improve it later)

There are few things you must know before using Server::FastPL

1. This is a client-server interface, you must do a server, that will run
the big code, and a small client, that runs a simple code, just to receive
information from anywhere and send to the server, then receive from the
server and do whatever you want. You'd prefer to be transparent, what means
that the client will have to exit exactly the same way the server does.

2. You might prefer to use the two small modules (Server::FastPL::Client and
Server::FastPL::Server), instead of the big (Server::FastPL). Doing this way
you will reduce the compile time of the client.

Any Questions??
